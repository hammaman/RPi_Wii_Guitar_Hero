SC

SC is a Python library publicly available on Github

This provides a Python library to interact with a Super Collider server using OSC

The standard library sets up the server and then generates sound.  I have adapted the code to work with
an existing server which is already running (as set up by Sonic Pi).

TO DO:
   Tidy up the code and finalise the library.  Suggesting renaming SC to an alternative name.
