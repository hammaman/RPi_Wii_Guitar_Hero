HOW TO SET UP YOUR PI TO GET STARTED

 1. Activate I2C on the Raspberry Pi
    I followed the Adafruit instructions here:
    https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c

    but there are also instructions here:
    http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-operating-systems/raspbian/io-pins-raspbian/i2c-pins

    I2C works using 4 connections:
      Positive voltage (3v3 which means 3.3 volts - in electronics, decimal points are avoided)
      Data channel #1 - SDA
      Data channel #2 - SCL
      Ground (GND or 0v)

    This is not the place for a wiring diagram!  So you will need to google to find out how to connect 4 leads to the headers 

 2. Connect the Nunchuk end (i.e. the end that goes into a Wiimote) to the Pi
    I am using an adapter (search for "wii nunchuk arduino adapter" on google)
    which is a small flat PCB which has one end to go into the nunchuk, and then 4 pins to make the I2C connection 

    An alternative is to simply wedge leads into the Nunchuk connector.  wiibrew.org (see link above) has a wiring diagram for where
    to attach the 4 leads onto the Nunchuk connector.

    All Nunchuk type devices are accessible via I2C protocol
    The device has an I2C "location" of 0x52

    This can be checked by running in the LXTerminal window (or command prompt if not using X):
       sudo i2cdetect -y 1
    NOTE: if you have an early Raspberry Pi (like I do), the I2C was setup differently to use 0
    i.e. the command becomes:   sudo i2cdetect -y 0

    If connected, you will see a grid with 52 mentioned in the middle
