RPi_Wii_Guitar_Hero
===================

This Python project aims to utilise the Rapsberry Pi Sonic Pi music capability to enable you to:

   * Create music in Sonic Pi programmatically
   * Use Guitar Hero instruments to jam along to music created in Sonic Pi
   
Requirements:

   * Raspberry Pi - any model running Raspian
   * Python v2 supplied with the Pi
   * Sonic Pi v1.1 (latest release available at 26 July 2014)
   * Wii Guitar Hero instruments, connecting the Wii Nunchuk output directly to the Pi GPIO using 4 wires (and the I2C protocol).  I am using a connector from EBay, but you can connect directly
   * Minimal music ability / talent
   * Long hair "rockers" wig for the authentic 80's rock look
   
Please refer to the other README files for details about Sonic Pi and setting up the instruments
