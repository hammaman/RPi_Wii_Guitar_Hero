Sonic Pi

Sonic Pi has been developed by Dr Sam Aaron, and is currently written in Ruby.

The source code is publicly available at:
   github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi
   
From working through the code with my limited knowledge of Ruby, I believe:

1. Sonic Pi uses the Super Collider server to generate sound, using port 4556
2. Sonic Pi sets up and runs the server on the Pi, together with Jackd, and ALSA functionality.
3. Notes are sent between the Sonic Pi workspaces and the server using OSC
